# Dark Side of the Moon
**A Visualizer for Rainmeter.**

One of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time is Pink Floyd's _The Dark Side of the Moon_ (1973). After the album's release, it remained on the Billboard Top 100 charts in the US for a whopping 954 weeks (that's more than 18 years and 4 months).

Anyone who's heard of Pink Floyd or _The Dark Side of the Moon_ (aka, _DTSOM_) has certainly seen one of the most iconic album covers ever made. Completely black, with no title or name of the band; just a prism refracting a beam of white light. Inside the gatefold cover, along with the song lyrics, the refracted light beam continues across -- with the signature "heartbeat" -- and wraps around to the back cover.  The back contains another prism, concentrating the prismatic rays back into a white ray of light which wraps around to the front, to start the cycle over again.

For some mysterious reason, no one to my knowledge has ever created a Rainmeter visualizer based on the album art.  While not _quite_ as cool as the real thing, this visualizer comes as close as I can get without a gatefolding double-sided monitor.

## Features
NOTE: Because this visualizer spans the complete width of your monitor, it is set to "click-through" so as to not interfere with your Windows desktop.  The downside is that there is no way to interact with the skin.  A Settings skin is provided and must be loaded either with the Rainmeter Manage dialog or by using the Rainmeter taskbar icon to select it.

Also, this skin is a visualizer **only**. It cannot and will not control your media player. You can use your preferred player skin for this task.

## Configuration
There are two settings for the visualizer.
* Click the moon/eclipse to toggle the visualizer on and off.
* Select your preferred media player from the list (these are the players supported natively by Rainmeter).

For best appearance, and to show the world how much of a Floyd fan you are, set your desktop wallpaper to solid black, like the album cover. Lesser fans can opt for a near-black desktop, though you may invite mild derision for your lack of dedication.
