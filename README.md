# Dark Side of the Moon
**A Visualizer for Rainmeter.**

One of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time is Pink Floyd's _The Dark Side of the Moon_ (1973). After the album's release, it remained on the Billboard Top 100 charts in the US for a whopping 954 weeks (that's more than 18 years and 4 months!).

Anyone who's heard of Pink Floyd, or _The Dark Side of the Moon_ (aka, _DTSOM_), has certainly seen one of the most iconic album covers ever made: completely black, with no title or name of the band, just a prism refracting a beam of white light. Inside the gatefold cover, along with the song lyrics, the refracted light beam continues across -- with the signature "heartbeat" -- and wraps around to the back cover. The back contains another prism, concentrating the prismatic rays back into a white ray of light which wraps around to the front, to start the cycle over again.

Back in 2018, I decided to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the album by creating a visualizer in the style of the album cover, using nothing but Shape meters and math. Ha! I never completed the task due to the complexity involved, but I finally completed it over a long weekend. While not _quite_ as cool as the real thing, this visualizer comes as close as I can get without a gatefolding double-sided monitor.

## Features
NOTE: Because this visualizer spans the complete width of your monitor, it is set to "click-through" so as to not interfere with your Windows desktop. The downside is that there is no way to interact with the skin. A Settings skin is provided and must be loaded either with the Rainmeter Manage dialog or by using the Rainmeter taskbar icon to select it.

Also, this skin is a visualizer **only**. It cannot and will not control your media player. You can use your preferred player skin for this task.

## Configuration
![](Images/Settings.png)

There are only a few simple settings for the visualizer.
* Click the moon/eclipse to toggle the visualizer on/off.
* Select your preferred media player from the list (these are players supported natively by Rainmeter).
* Queue up album (preferably the remastered 5.1 mix), turn out the lights, and crank the volume! (Also playing the _Wizard of Oz_ is optional.)

For best appearance, and to show the world how much of a die-hard Floyd fan you are, set your desktop wallpaper to solid black, like the album cover. Lesser fans can opt for a near-black desktop, though you may invite mild derision for your lack of dedication.
